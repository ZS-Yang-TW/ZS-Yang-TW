## 🚀 About Me

I’m a web engineer working at NTUCOOL, the digital learning platform of National Taiwan University, where I build scalable tools for 30,000+ learners and teachers — from video systems, PDF annotation, to AI-powered features.

Beyond web development, I’m passionate about the intersection of education and technology. I see teaching as a lifelong mission. With a master’s in educational technology and a teacher training background, I’ve designed and taught AI courses for high schools, led coding workshops, and co-founded an EdTech startup focused on automating math video creation using Manim and generative AI.

I’m driven to build meaningful learning tools that empower others to teach, learn, and grow. 
If you care about building better ways to teach and learn, let’s connect and make it happen.
